# ActiveRecord association testing with RSpec

This is small example how you could test ActiveRecord associations & options with RSpec.

### Dependencies
- SQLite3
- Ruby 2.3.0 (you could try to change .ruby-version also)

Please let me know if you have had any problems with running this example so I could update repositoy/documentation if necessary.

Tested on:
- OS: OS X El Capitan 10.11.1
- Ruby version: 2.3.0
- Ruby Version Manager: Chruby (with .ruby-version autodetection)
